# playlist-search

Used to search the playlist data from Spotify that I've synced to a local sqlite database, `~/playlister.db`, created with [Playlister](https://github.com/ccb012100/playlister).

## TODO

- [x] organize files
- [ ] improve matching on sqlite queries so that accented characters match on their unaccented equivalents
- [ ] visualisation of database schema
- [x] BUG: adding to all_albums still includes albums that were removed from playlists
